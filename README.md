# Maze Generator and Solver Program

Welcome to the Maze Generator and Solver Program! This repository contains a [programming language]-based program that generates random mazes and solves them using various algorithms. Whether you're interested in learning about maze generation, solving strategies, or just having fun with mazes, this program has got you covered.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create randomized mazes using Kruskal's algorithm.
- **Maze Solving:** Solve generated mazes using Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search algorithms.
## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create randomized mazes using Kruskal's algorithm.
- **Maze Solving:** Solve generated mazes using Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact with the program seamlessly through the command-line interface.
  - **Maze Size:** Define the dimensions of the maze (rows and columns) to generate mazes of varying sizes.
  - **Wall Removal:** Specify the number of walls to remove after maze generation, increasing the number of possible solutions.
  - **Start and Target Locations:** Set the starting point and target destination within the maze.
